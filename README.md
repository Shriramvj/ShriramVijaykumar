# 👋 Hey there, I'm Shriram Vijaykumar!

I'm a Data Enthusiast with a deep passion for uncovering insights and telling compelling stories through data. My journey in data analytics and engineering has led me to work on a variety of exciting projects, each pushing the boundaries of what's possible with data. From predictive modeling to crafting interactive dashboards, I love every step of the process.

### 🔍 What I Do:

- **🧠 Data Storytelling:** I believe that data has a story to tell, and I’m here to translate complex datasets into narratives that drive impact. Whether it’s through visualizations or detailed reports, I strive to make data accessible and actionable.
  
- **📊 Dashboard Design:** There’s nothing quite like the satisfaction of creating a dashboard that’s both beautiful and functional. I’ve built dashboards that streamline decision-making processes, reduce analysis time, and bring real-time insights to the forefront.

- **🤖 Predictive Analytics & Machine Learning:** I’m fascinated by the power of predictive analytics. Using Python, SQL, and a range of machine learning libraries, I’ve developed models that forecast trends, predict outcomes, and uncover hidden patterns in data.

### 🔭 Current Interests:

- **Human-Centered Data Design:** Exploring how data can be visualized in ways that are not just informative, but also intuitive and human-friendly.
- **Advanced Machine Learning:** Diving into neural networks and deep learning techniques to push the boundaries of predictive analytics.
- **Big Data Analytics:** Working with large datasets using cloud platforms like Google Big Query to extract meaningful insights at scale.
- **Healthcare Data:** Passionate about using data to improve healthcare outcomes, particularly in understanding patient journeys and treatment efficacy.

### 💼 Projects I’m Proud Of:

#### **1. Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones**
Using accelerometer and gyroscope data, I built a model that achieves over 94% accuracy in recognizing human activities. This project involved:
- **Technologies Used:** Python, ML Libraries (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
- **Key Achievements:** Successfully deployed Softmax Regression and custom neural networks, leading to high accuracy and reliability for real-world applications.
